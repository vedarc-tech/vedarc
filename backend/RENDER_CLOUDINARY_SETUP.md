# Cloudinary Setup for Render Deployment

## ‚úÖ Security Fix Applied

**IMPORTANT**: Your Cloudinary credentials were exposed in the GitHub repository. This has been fixed by:
1. Removing hardcoded credentials from the test file
2. Using environment variables instead
3. Creating a secure example file

## üîí Environment Variables Setup

### For Local Development:
1. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory
2. Add your Cloudinary credentials (see `env.example` for structure):
```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

### For Render Deployment:
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Select your backend service (`api.vedarc.co.in`)
3. Go to **Environment** tab
4. Add these environment variables:
```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

## üö® Security Actions Required

### 1. **Rotate Your Cloudinary API Keys**
Since your credentials were exposed, you should:
1. Go to your Cloudinary dashboard
2. Generate new API keys
3. Update the environment variables with the new keys
4. Delete the old keys

### 2. **Check for Unauthorized Usage**
Monitor your Cloudinary account for any unauthorized usage since the credentials were exposed.

### 3. **Update Environment Variables**
Use the new API keys in both:
- Local `.env` file
- Render environment variables

## ‚úÖ What This Enables

‚úÖ **Fast Image Loading**: Intern profile photos will load instantly via Cloudinary CDN
‚úÖ **Automatic Optimization**: Images are automatically optimized for web
‚úÖ **Face Detection**: Profile photos are automatically cropped to focus on faces
‚úÖ **Format Conversion**: Images are converted to the best format (WebP/AVIF) for modern browsers
‚úÖ **Fallback Support**: If Cloudinary fails, images still work via local storage

## üîß Testing

To test Cloudinary locally:
```bash
cd backend
python test_cloudinary.py
```

The test script now uses environment variables instead of hardcoded credentials.

## üìã Deployment Status

- ‚úÖ **Requirements.txt**: Updated with Python 3.13 compatible versions
- ‚úÖ **Pillow**: Fixed version compatibility issue
- ‚úÖ **Cloudinary**: Updated to latest version (1.44.1)
- ‚úÖ **FPDF**: Added missing dependency
- ‚úÖ **Security**: Removed hardcoded credentials
- ‚úÖ **Backend Code**: All certificate verification endpoints implemented
- ‚úÖ **Frontend Code**: All certificate verification components implemented
- ‚è≥ **Render Deployment**: In progress (wait 2-3 minutes)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Rotate Cloudinary API keys** (IMPORTANT for security)
2. **Update environment variables** with new keys
3. **Wait for Render deployment** (2-3 minutes)
4. **Test the Certificate Verifier** in manager dashboard
5. **Test public verification** via footer link

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Reminder

Never commit API keys, passwords, or other sensitive credentials to version control. Always use environment variables for sensitive data.
